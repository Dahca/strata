1. correct and re-enable unlink syscall
    Currently, unlink still breaks the correctness of filesystem, and unlink syscall is totally ignored in libshim

2. optimize libfs extent tree nodes reading
    Previously, libfs will only read each extent tree node once. Currently, libfs will re-read each extent tree everytime need them. A better implementation should be: bookkeep which buffer is read by which inode, then invalidate all buffers related to an inode at sync_inode_ext_tree
